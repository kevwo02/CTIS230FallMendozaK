          <p> <h3> <em> <strong> <em> </em>Reasoning: </em> </strong> </h3> <p> The common law of defense of necessity, also known as choices of evils defense, implies that the evil crime is justifiable because a greater harm could have occurred if it was not for the evil to intervene. Toops taking control of the vehicle while intoxicated was a lesser evil because he prevented harm to the people in the car and outside property that could have caused more damage. Since Indiana had no previous background on this issue, they applied and agree with California’s case that dealt with a similar situation and used their “prerequisites in establishing a necessity defense: </p> 
            <ol start="1"> 
           <li>   the act charged as criminal must have been done to prevent a significant evil; </li> 
            <li>   there must have been no adequate alternative to the commission of the act; </li> 
            <li>  the harm caused by the act must not be disproportionate to the harm avoided; </li> 
             <li>  the accused must entertain a good-faith belief that his act was necessary to prevent greater harm; </li> 
           <li>   such belief must be objectively reasonable under all the circumstances; </li> 
           <li>  the accused must not have substantially contributed to the creation of the emergency. </li> 
         </ol>
             Since Toops actions fell into one these categories, his evil stopped a much greater evil and because of that his conviction was dropped.
