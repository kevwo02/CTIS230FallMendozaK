            <p> <h3> <em> <strong> <em> </em> Procedural History: </em> </strong> </h3> </p>  The state dismissed these charges but after the trail the jury decided to convict him of the DUI. “At the close of evidence, Toops tendered the proposed jury instruction: The Defendant in this case has raised the defense of “Necessity” to excuse his assuming the controls of the vehicle at a time when he was intoxicated. “Necessity” involves a choice between two admitted evils where other options are unavailable. “Necessity” justifies illegal conduct if that conduct was the sole reasonable alternative available to Defendant given the circumstances of the case.” The trial court refused his instruction as they saw no necessity in this case. After further review, “The instruction represents an incomplete statement of the law. That incompleteness is understandable however because no Indiana case has specifically set forth the elements of the necessity defense.” The DUI conviction was reversed and remanded.
