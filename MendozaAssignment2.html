   <p>  Toops v. State - 643 N.E.2d 387 (1994) </p> 
    <p> <h3> <em> <strong>  Facts: </em> </strong> </h3> </p> Terry Toops and his two friends, Warren Cripe (who was a minor during the time) and Ed Raisor, were drinking at Toops’ house and decided to go out for a drive that night. Cripe drives due to the other being too intoxicated to drive and they begin their drive at 3 am. During their drive, Cripe notices police officials were following them because of Toops’ crazy actions and he becomes nervous and decides to let go of the wheel and jumps into the backseat. As the car loses control, Toops jumps into the driver’s seat and regains control of the car. They are pulled over and Toops takes a breath test. His BAC was .21%; he was placed under arrest, and was charged with Criminal Recklessness, Operating a Vehicle Without a Seat Belt, and Driving Left of Center. 
   <p> <h3> <em> <strong> <em> </em> Procedural History: </em> </strong> </h3> </p>  The state dismissed these charges but after the trail the jury decided to convict him of the DUI. “At the close of evidence, Toops tendered the proposed jury instruction: The Defendant in this case has raised the defense of “Necessity” to excuse his assuming the controls of the vehicle at a time when he was intoxicated. “Necessity” involves a choice between two admitted evils where other options are unavailable. “Necessity” justifies illegal conduct if that conduct was the sole reasonable alternative available to Defendant given the circumstances of the case.” The trial court refused his instruction as they saw no necessity in this case. After further review, “The instruction represents an incomplete statement of the law. That incompleteness is understandable however because no Indiana case has specifically set forth the elements of the necessity defense.” The DUI conviction was reversed and remanded. 
   <p> <h3> <em> <strong> <em> </em>Issue: </em> </strong> </h3> </p>  Was driving drunk a lesser evil than a car out of control?
   <p> <h3> <em> <strong> <em> </em>Holding: </em> </strong> </h3> </p>  Yes, because there could have been a lot more harm. The case was reversed and remanded. 
   <p> <h3> <em> <strong> <em> </em>Reasoning: </em> </strong> </h3> <p> The common law of defense of necessity, also known as choices of evils defense, implies that the evil crime is justifiable because a greater harm could have occurred if it was not for the evil to intervene. Toops taking control of the vehicle while intoxicated was a lesser evil because he prevented harm to the people in the car and outside property that could have caused more damage. Since Indiana had no previous background on this issue, they applied and agree with California’s case that dealt with a similar situation and used their “prerequisites in establishing a necessity defense: </p> 
   <ol start="1"> 
  <li>   the act charged as criminal must have been done to prevent a significant evil; </li> 
   <li>   there must have been no adequate alternative to the commission of the act; </li> 
   <li>  the harm caused by the act must not be disproportionate to the harm avoided; </li> 
    <li>  the accused must entertain a good-faith belief that his act was necessary to prevent greater harm; </li> 
  <li>   such belief must be objectively reasonable under all the circumstances; </li> 
  <li>  the accused must not have substantially contributed to the creation of the emergency. </li> 
</ol>
    Since Toops actions fell into one these categories, his evil stopped a much greater evil and because of that his conviction was dropped.
